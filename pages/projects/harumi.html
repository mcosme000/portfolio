        <h2>About this project</h2>
        <p>
          This is the final project of the Google UX Design Specialization course. During the last few weeks we were
          learning about responsive design and how important it is to create designs that adapt to any screen size.
          Therefore, our final task was to create a website design in various formats.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my case, I chose to make it about a bakery. Near my house there is a well known bakery where there are
          always people waiting, so it was my inspiration for this project.

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Harumi Bakery is a local business in Setagaya Ward, Tokyo, that have been on business for 30 years. They offer
          different types of bread, but their cakes are their most famous product and the ones that sell out the
          fastest. Since they added these cakes to their menu, they have gained even more popularity and have been
          showcases in different travel and food magazines. Everyday there are a lot of customers waiting in line to buy
          those cakes, but not everybody is able to get one.

            <h2>The problem</h2>
            <p>
              This bakery doesn't have any system that allows customers to place preorders. Because of that, they need
              to wait in line for long periods of time.

          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>The solution</h2>
            <p>
              Design a fully functional and responsive website for the business that is intuitive for all types of
              customers and that allows them to easily check the menu and make preorders.
