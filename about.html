          <p>I'm from Spain and I'm a self-taught frontend developer and UX/UI designer. I currently
            live in Nara, Japan.
          </p>
          <p>
            Due to Covid-19, I had to quit my job as a hostel receptionist after almost 4 years. I decided it was time
            to look for new challenges, so I started learning programming that same year. Last year I also got
            interested in UX/UI design.
          </p>
          <p>
            What I like most about this field is not only the designing part, but also getting to know the different
            users, their needs and objectives, and progressing little by little until I manage to design the best product
            for each of them.

        <h2>Some facts about me...</h2>
        <p>
          - I love photography, especially after moving to Japan. A few years ago I started taking film photos and apart
          from how beautiful the pictures look, I love taking double exposures with my camera.
        </p>
        <p>
          - I wanted to study veterinary medicine, but I didn't get enough marks. Now I'm glad I didn't get in because
          I'm very sensitive to animals and I would be crying every day.
        </p>
        <p>
          - I have two dogs called Ponchan and Suchan and their names together are very similar to Ponzu, a citrus
          sauce that is used a lot in Japanese cuisine.
        </p>
        <p>
          - Recently we moved to Nara, bought an old house and we are remodeling it whenever we have time! It is fun,
          but made me realize the amount of things you can choose when you can actually change ANYTHING in your house.
